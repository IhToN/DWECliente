The geolocation API allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they so desire. For privacy reasons, the user is asked for permission to report location information.

The geolocation API is published through the navigator.geolocation object. If the object exists, geolocation services are available.

    Develop a web app in which:
        Test if geolocation is available.
        If it's available, show the current position (latitude and longitude)
        If it isn't available, show a message for each and everyone of the possible errors.
        Improve your code so you show the position continuously (although the user could be in moving, so it could change)
        Find the way to measure the distance traveled.

    Let's try to use the geolocation information with the API of Google Maps.
        Use a map to show your location
        Draw a marker in your location
        Find a way to know the address of your location (reverse geocoding).

    OPTIONAL. Complete exercise 2 with these new features:
        Look for the way to animate your marker
        Draw the position of the user correctly although it could be moving.
        Draw the route of the user over the map.
